Interpretability: XAI focuses on making AI models interpretable by humans. It aims to provide insights into how the model makes predictions or decisions. This is crucial, especially in applications where understanding the model's reasoning is important, such as in healthcare or finance.

Transparency: XAI promotes transparency in AI systems. It involves making the inner workings of AI models more accessible and understandable to non-experts. This transparency helps users and stakeholders trust the AI's output.

Explanations: XAI techniques provide explanations for AI model predictions. Instead of just getting an output, users can also receive information on why the AI arrived at that particular result. Explanations can take the form of visualizations, text, or other human-understandable formats.

Model Accountability: XAI helps hold AI models accountable for their decisions. Users can trace back the decision process to identify potential biases or errors.

Human-Centric Design: XAI considers the needs and capabilities of humans who interact with AI systems. It aims to make AI more user-friendly and aligned with human values and decision-making processes.

Ethical Considerations: XAI is closely related to ethical AI. Ensuring that AI models are explainable can help prevent unintended consequences and biases. It also makes it easier to assess and address ethical issues.

Applications: XAI is essential in various fields, including healthcare (diagnosis and treatment recommendations), finance (credit scoring), autonomous vehicles, and legal systems (evidence analysis).
